The original game can be found [here](http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/). This project uses fork from [ozh](https://github.com/ozh/cookieclicker).

I know original game should not be re-hosted, but this was the only way I could make this combination work. This is for demonstration only, it is not a real playable version. For that please visit the [original cookie clicker](http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/) website.
